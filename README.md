# CONSISTENSY Prototype 01

The idea is to create an application that helps people stay consistent in desired daily activities.

    . I want to be able to add a new activity in my dashboard
        . I want to be able to set the duration for this routine (eg, it could be a routine i want to do during the holidays, or a routine I want to keep doing forever)
        . I want to be able to set the frequency for the routine
    . I want to be able to track my activities and tick them once done
